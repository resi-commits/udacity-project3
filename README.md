# Weather Journal App
This project contains an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather-Journal App.

The basic source code was forked from the fend repository (https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019), but the files were modified. The structure from `index.html` was adapted. This repository contains the following files:
* `/README.md`: you are currently reading it
* `/server.js`: this file contains the server side code, the server is listening to port 5500
* `/website/index.html`: this file contains the HTML structure of the weather journal 
* `/website/css/style.css`: this file contains all the styling for my weather journal
* `/website/css/src/`: this directory contains the background image of the weather journal
* `/website/js/app.js`: this file conains the client side code for the weather journal app
